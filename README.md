## Information
Ange is being developed as a security bot for a private server. The source code can be downloaded and self hosted, but it is designed for use only in The Hangout and will not work in another server without tweaking. There are other bots that perform the same function as this one available online, I would recommend using those. This was just a fun project for me.
